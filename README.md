#Scheduler
The scheduler will be an application that allows users to view possible schedules for activities during a given period of time. The application will allow users to create activities that want to be accomplished during the given time. It will also allow users to create conditions for activities or groups of activities, such as when a user wakes up, or what times the user would prefer to go to the gym. Given these activities and conditions, the application will provide optimal schedule options for the user for the given period of time.
