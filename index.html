<h1 id="scheduler">Scheduler</h1>
<p>An application by Team Scheduler<br />
CSC 413 Advanced Software Development I<br />
Spring 2015</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="overview-of-the-software">Overview of the software</h2>
<p>The scheduler will be an application that allows users to view possible schedules for activities during a given period of time. The application will allow users to create activities that want to be accomplished during the given time. It will also allow users to create conditions for activities or groups of activities, such as when a user wakes up, or what times the user would prefer to go to the gym. Given these activities and conditions, the application will provide optimal schedule options for the user for the given period of time.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="initial-requirements">Initial requirements</h2>
<p>The basis for the project was to create an application that implemented a database and web-based user interface. Our software would create a locally hosted database that communicated with the application and create events with the restrictions given by the user.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>
<p>The functional aim of the project at launch was to create an interactable user interface to which activities/events with restrictions, such as the duration, time, and date, could be added by the user. In the case that the user does not input a specific time or date for an event, the application will give the user an optimized schedule that includes each event.</p>

<li>Brandon Olson</li>
<li>Nathan Reline</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
<p>In order to complete the project, the team had to become familiar with how a database and web server work. To provide a uniform build system while using version control between the team members, we sought out to learn Maven and the other benefits it brought with it, which included making the build process easier within our environment and giving guidelines for practices during development. In relation to the scope of the project, we decided that the best option for calculating the most optimized schedule for the user was by using a genetic algorithm, another field we had yet to approach. Last, but not least, was the front end side of development. Members of the team either used JavaFX for the first time and learned how to use the software platform or furthered their knowledge and efficiency for better future usage.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="software-architecture">Software architecture</h2>
<p>For this project, we implemented a number of different tools that ended up in our project architecture.</p>
<ul>
<li>Java</li>
<li>JavaFX</li>
<li>Apache Tomcat</li>
<li>H2 Database</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="java">Java</h3>
<p>We chose Java as our primary programming language because of Java's powerful code-once run everywhere mentality. We also chose Java to take advantage of the JavaFX library, which is a library included in the Java Development Kit (JDK) that aids in the creation of graphical user interfaces (GUI). If you'd like to learn more about Java, click <a href="https://www.java.com/en/about/">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="javafx">JavaFX</h3>
<p>After some research on JavaFX, we found we could run JavaFX applications in a browser, which would allow us to use our Java code and our existing knowledge of JavaFX to create the web interface. If you'd like to learn more about JavaFX, click <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/get-started-tutorial/jfx-overview.htm#JFXST784">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="apache-tomcat">Apache Tomcat</h3>
<p>Apache Tomcat was chosen over other Java servers, because research showed it to be the most supported, and really well documented. It also came with an embeddable version, which allowed us to easily embed a server instance into our application. With the tomcat server embedded into the application, we didnâ€™t have to worry about the user needing to setup a standalone server and managing the apps that are installed on the server. If you'd like to learn more about Apache Tomcat, click <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="h2-database">H2 Database</h3>
<p>H2 Database was our database of choice, because of it's Java compatibility, it's size, and it's ability to run in embedded mode. With the database embedded in the application, we minimize the amount of work the user has to do to run and maintain the application. If you'd like to learn more about H2 Database, click <a href="http://www.h2database.com/html/main.html">here</a>.</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="database">Database</h2>
<p>As mentioned before, we chose to use H2 Database for our database implementation. We opted to run H2 in embedded mode, which would allow the database to exist within the application, and create less hassle on the user's end by not requiring them to run an external database.</p>
<p>The tables in the database were optimized to third normal form to keep data from being duplicated within the database. Duplicated data is never a good idea, as data that needs to be changed would have to be changed in multiple tables, making the work harder for ourselves.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="web-interface">Web interface</h2>
<p>Still working on it...</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="what-we-completed">What we completed</h2>
<p>In the end, we completed the basis for a scheduling web-interface application with a client-server model. Firstly, we were able to create a server that the user was able to launch on the host computer. The server has an interface in which a user can specify a port, launch the server, and end the server. On the client-side, the user is able to launch a web browser and connect to the server to give the client access the user interface. </p>
